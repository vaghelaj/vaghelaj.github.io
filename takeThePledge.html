                        Campaign.

                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Burlington Fire Department was in need of a solution that allows them to spend the least
                        amount of their time possible travelling to houses to educate and remind residents of their fire
                        safety plan.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p> A application which provides a way for Burlington residents to take a pledge ensuring their
                        smoke and carbon monoxide alarms are present and up to date. At the same time allowing employees
                        of the Burlington Fire Department to use this information to track number of houses that have
                        taken the pledge.</p>

                    <h3>Role</h3>
                    <p>
                        My role in the project was to design a website that can facilitate the requirements made.
                        <br>
                        - First, allowing the residents of the Burlington area to take the pledge and keep up to date
                        with news about the Burlington Fire Department.
                        <br>
                        - Second, the website should allow the Burlington Fire Department employees view this data using
                        some sort of mapping feature.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-sections">
                <h2 class="project-overview-subheading">Research</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>Identifying our users</h3>
                    <p> After discussing with the associated employee at the Burlington Fire Department, it was
                        discussed the website will predominately be viewed by residents in the Burlington area and be
                        monitor by the fire department employees.</p>

                    <h3>Implementation</h3>
                    <p> We were given complete authority on the design of the website and the technologies used.
                        I took the decision of using the colour palette from the Burlington logo, to make the website
                        feel part of the official Burlington website allowing for a more cohesive experience.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Final Designs</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since this project was part of my college course and it was under a strict time constraint. I
                        decided to continue the design directly into high-fidelity as I felt I had a good gasp as to
                        what the website should look like and what kind of content will be placed in it.
                        <br> <br>
                        
                        <span id="note-paragraph">
                            Note: It was decided at the time of planning that the website will be part of the official area of
                            Burlington website.

                    <p>
                        The content of the ‘Take the Pledge’ form were discussed with the Burlington Fire Department
                        employees. A point to be made about the form is that the form does not have to completely filled
                        as not everyone is a house owner. The users can provide the information they feel most
                        comfortable giving out.

                    <p>
                        Since we had established that the website will used by two very separate users and our approach
                        consist of having a single website that can do everything. We decided upon implementing a login
                        where employees can login their credentials and view data about the pledges.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Dashboard</h3>
                    <p>
                        The dashboard consists of a mapping feature for viewing the pledges where each pin represents
                        the different individuals who have taken the pledge and since the form can be completely or
                        partially filled, the colour of the pins help differentiate.
                        <br> <br>
                        The Burlington Fire Department employees can filter through the pledges based on the selected
                        filter option and click on the individual's pins or addresses to view specifically what that
                        household has filled out in the form.

                    <p>
                        As this was first and fore most a final project for our college Human Computer Interaction
                        course, the team was able to meet the requirements successfully. On the other hand, the project
                        did not move forward with the Burlington Fire Department.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Learnings</h3>
                    <p>
                        The project did teach what kind of work is involved in designing a product for an organization
                        and the process that goes into it.
