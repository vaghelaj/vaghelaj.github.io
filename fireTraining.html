                <div>
                    <p>
                        This is an educational project carried out as part of my 4th year at Sheridan College. The team
                        worked closely with the associated project supervisors to implement a solution that will provide
                        fire safety training using Microsoft HoloLens Mixed Reality technology.
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h3 class="project-content-sections-headings">The Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        There is a large number of individuals who lack hands-on fire safety training. Some of the
                        reasons that's causing this are,
                        <br>
                        ● Lack of publicly open fire safety training sessions
                        <br>
                        ● Fire safety training is a very costly process
                        <br>
                        ● Current training uses large sums of single use material
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p> An augmented reality application that simulates the emergency fire situations and teaches the
                        individual proper evacuation and extinguisher procedures in a safe and exciting way.</p>

                    <h3>Role</h3>
                    <p>
                        My role in the project was to design and develop a Android application that acts as an
                        controller for initiating training processes.
                    </p>

            <div class="project-content-sections">
                <h2 class="project-overview-subheading">Research</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>Identifying our users</h3>
                    <p> Upon discussing with the team and associated supervisors, it was established that the system is
                        going to be used by two different users. First user being the trainee, who part takes in
                        acquiring fire safety training while the trainer (our second user) monitors and administrates
                        the trainee's process during the entire training sessions. </p>

                    <h3>Designing the infrastructure</h3>
                    <p> Since we were implementing this system from the ground up, one of our major task was to design
                        an infrastructure that would best structure the system and provide a seamless user experience.
                    </p>

                <h2 class="project-overview-subheading">Devices breakdown by users</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>Users 1: Trainer (Left)</h3>
                    <p> The trainer is using the "Simulation Controller" i.e., the Android tablet to control the fire
                        training simulation. They have the ability to set different attributes for the training
                        simulation based on the trainee's fire safety knowledge.</p>

                    <h3>Users 2: Trainee (Right)</h3>
                    <p> The trainee on the other hand, will use three devices simulateously as they progress through the
                        simulation. First or primary device, they will be using for the duration of the training will
                        the Microsoft Hololens headset. Second, the fire extinguisher (a raspberry pi device, consist of
                        a button which when triggered initiates the extinguisher foam animation on the hololens) which
                        they will use to extinguish the fire. Lastly, the 911 call device (an Android phone app) which
                        they will use almost towards the end of the simulation that is once all the safety procedures
                        prior have been completed</p>

                    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since I was responsible for the designing the trainer Android application. I started out by
                        first designing wireframes and my thinking throughout the designing phrase was to make the
                        trainer have easy access to all the high-level controls that is required for setting up a
                        training sessions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Design Solution</h3>
                    <p>
                        The solution, a split screen layout where the left of the dashboard consists of the trainee’s
                        information which updates as the training progresses while the right panel contains all the
                        controls. For other information such as trainer information, trainee's session information are
                        display in dialog boxes as those information are viewed either at the beginning or ending of a
                        session.

                <div>
                    <h3>Final designs</h3>
                    <p>
                        As project moved forward, new features were added to the application and since we were a in time
                        constraint the changes were directly implemented into the final designs.
                        <br> <br>
                        Some of changes included of a session information dialog, changing the start/stop simulation
                        button position and introducing a restart simulation button. Reshuffling the controls panel UI
                        controls such as using radio buttons instead of regular buttons as its more clear and enforces
                        the idea only one can be selected.
                        <br> <br>
                        Also the fire level slider was removed and the difficulty slider component is replaced with
                        radio buttons, this decision was made as a team since we felt that the difficulty and fire level
                        values was redundant.
                    </p>


                    <h3>Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        The application was developed in Android studios and is written in Java. The application uses a
                        variety of Android packages, most important being Socket.io which helps the application
                        communciate with the system's server.

                    <p>
                        The team was successfully able to provide a fully working system within the given time
                        constraints and were able to build a product that met our proposed goals.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Learnings</h3>
                    <p>
                        The technology used in the project was fairly new to the team and it presented a steep learning
                        curve. Especially figuring out device connectivity issues as each device had their own
                        constraints which had to be kept in mind when building out the system. But overall the project
                        did help understand the process of manipulating hardware devices using different software
                        technologies.
